# Kentucky Dams 
## Overview
 The 3 maps I have created depict Kentucky's water basins and dams, Kentucky's water basins and dam prevalence per county (using a red graduated color scheme) and the Big Sandy/Little Sandy and Tygarts Creek basins. By looking at these maps you should be able to see roughly which basins have the more dams than others, the range of which counties have a lot of dams or very few, and the amount of dams in the 2 specific basins listed above. The water basins are labeled for viewers to be able to learn about the different KY water basins and to see which one their county may be in. I chose to make these maps because I am very interested in Kentucky's waterways. Kentucky has the most navigable waterways in the US second only to Alaska. Water is a very important natural resource in Kentucky and I chose to highlight dams and water basins because I was curious the amount of dams in KY in relation to water basins. 
 ## Data
 * Regulated Dams data set: https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/kygeonet::ky-water-resources-regulated-dams/about
 * KY River Basins data: https://opengisdata.ky.gov/datasets/kygeonet::ky-basin-team-areas/about
 * KY Counties data: https://data.lojic.org/datasets/kygeonet::ky-county-lines/about
 * KY State Outline data: https://www.igismap.com/download-kentucky-state-gis-maps-boundary-counties-rail-highway/

 ## Procedure
 In QGIS I added the KY state outline layer, added the KY county layer, KY regulated dam data, and KY river basin layer. I made a join layer for the KY counties and the dam data so that I could show the amount of dams per county using a graduated color scheme. I also labeled the KY river basins. I used the CRS 3089 which is Kentucky Single Zone.
