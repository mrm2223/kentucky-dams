# Kentucky Dams 
## Overview
 This map shows Kentucky's streams, waterbodies, urban areas, and dams. By looking at this map you should be able to see dams in relation to urban areas as well as larger bodies of water. The urban areas are labeled and so are the waterbodies. I am very interested in Kentucky's watersheds and water organizations which led me to want to make a map about Kentucky Water. I have also recently learned about local dams in my areas which led me to create this map that combines Kentucky's water and streams with locations of dams. 
 ## Data
 Here is a link to the Kentucky Geological Society where I go my KY dam data: (https://www.uky.edu/KGS/gis/hydro.htm)
 The Ky state outline, counties, and urban areas were sourced from: (https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2022/)
 ## Procedure
 In QGIS I added data from the National Atlas of the United States and filtered the state, waterbodies, stream, and urban areas layers for Kentucky specifically using queries and then exported them as GeoJSONs. For the stream layer I styled it by categorizing by Strahler order. I also added feature names for the urban areas and waterbodies. I then added the dam layer that was already filtered to Kentucky and changed the point size and color. I used the CRS 3089 which is Kentucky Single Zone.
